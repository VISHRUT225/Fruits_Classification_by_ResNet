## Overview 🚀
**Fruits Classification by ResNet** is an end-to-end deep learning project that leverages transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet model to accurately classify fruit images. This project covers data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and real-time inference—all in one comprehensive workflow.

## Project Objectives 🎯
- **Accurate Classification:** Distinguish between various fruit types using a deep learning approach.
- **Efficient Transfer Learning:** Utilize a pre-trained ResNet model to boost performance and reduce training time.
- **Robust Data Handling:** Implement comprehensive data preprocessing and augmentation.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Assess model performance through multiple metrics and visualizations.
- **Scalable Inference:** Provide a framework for real-time fruit classification and deployment.

## Technologies & Techniques ⚙️
- **Deep Learning & Transfer Learning:** Pre-trained ResNet models (e.g., ResNet-50) for robust feature extraction.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Utilize convolutional layers to automatically learn image features.
- **Data Augmentation:** Techniques such as rotations, flips, scaling, and cropping to enhance dataset variability.
- **Optimization Algorithms:** Employ the Adam optimizer for adaptive learning during training.
- **Regularization & Callbacks:** Implement early stopping, learning rate scheduling, and dropout to prevent overfitting.
- **Visualization Tools:** Use Matplotlib for plotting training progress and performance metrics.
